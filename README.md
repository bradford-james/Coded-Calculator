# Calculator

### \#TODO

* accept input as singles (number or operand)
* will have an item in memory as rolling value
* will need memory for operand
* need cache for cached value
	* 5 cached values, which can be iterated through
		* add button, iterate, and clear
		* what does All Clear do to cache?
* Some operaters don't require a second value
* A number must be the first input
* Sequential operands will replace each other
* Prevent multiple decimals
* Some number modifiers (+/-)
* display limit
* decimal limit
* value limit (switch to exponent?)
* handle errors like divide by zero
* square root needs an imaginary number handler
* always show zero if nothing in memory, initialization
* hitting enter again will repeat the operation
* clear and all clear
